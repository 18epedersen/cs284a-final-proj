<h2> Title, Summary and Team Members </h2>
<p class="question"> Title </p>
<p class="question"> Summary </p>
<p class="question"> Team members </p>
<h2> Problem Description </h2>
<p class="question"> Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, why it is important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it. </p>
<h2> Goals and Deliverables </h2>
<p class="question"> If you are working on an interactive system, describe what demo you will create. </p>
<p class="question"> Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try. </p>
<p class="question"> What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis? </p>
<p class="question"> You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver. In (1), describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you expect (i.e. your baseline plan -- planning for some unexpected problems would make sense). In (2), describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan). </p>
<h2> Schedule </h2>
<p class="question"> In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week. </p>
<h2> Resources </h2>
<p class="question"> List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer to it here. </p>
